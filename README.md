# HSS Group Chat
==================================================================================
Assalamualaikum!
Esteemed Alumni of our very own Hazara Students Society - HSS,
Hope you all are enjoying a great vigor and life ahead of campus. 
Times have changed, millimeters have become centimeters and time really flies.
One thing which remained constant is love for our land & culture.

### Aim of Alumni Group

It's an us moment for all of us, about how passionate we were on campus, working for the prestige of HSS even more than our today's full time jobs. 😂
Mashallah, proud of all the amazing work you all have been doing in various verticals across STEM and contributing towards the nation's economy.
It's a matter of fact, that we used to be very close when on campus, again the bonding between us was HSS only. We were from different streams.
Today, we need to shift that senior-junior relationship towards a more fruitful professional relationship.
In a nutshell, the main aim of this group is to reconnect, rejoice and let's help each other achieve their goals by connecting the dots in industry / practical life.
